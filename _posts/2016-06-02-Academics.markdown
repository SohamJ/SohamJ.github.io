**_Introduction_**<br>
I received my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science from Rutgers University, NJ. I pursued the first two years of my bachelors at Pune Institute of Computer Technology, India(PICT). <br>

---------------------------------------------------------

**_Independent Study_**

In senior year, I undertook an independent study under Dr. Ulrich Kremer. My work was focused on maintaining a runtime system for a service-based framework and developing a heuristic that obtained a sub-optimal solution to maximize the overall objective at minimum energy consumption
