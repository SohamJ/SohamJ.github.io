description: I received my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science from Rutgers University, NJ.

I completed the following courses at Rutgers:

    Operating Systems                |  Systems Programming
    ---------------------------------|  -----------------------------------
    Compilers                        |  Principles of Programming Languages
    ---------------------------------|  -----------------------------------
    Design and Analysis of Algorithms|  Internet Technology
        
    You can see my academic projects on <a href="https://github.com/SohamJ?tab=repositories" target="_blank" >Github </a>.

    In senior year, I undertook an independent study under Dr. Ulrich Kremer. My work was focused on maintaining a runtime system for a service-based framework and developing a heuristic that obtained a sub-optimal solution to maximize the overall objective at minimum energy consumption.
