**_Introduction_**<br>
I received my Bachelors of Science in _Computer Science_ from Rutgers University, NJ. I pursued the first two years of my bachelors at Pune Institute of Computer Technology, India(PICT). I also pursued a minor in _Cognitive Science_ at Rutgers. <br>

**_Independent Study_**

In senior year, I undertook an independent study under Dr. Ulrich Kremer. My work was focused on maintaining a runtime system for a _service-based framework_ and developing a heuristic that obtained a sub-optimal solution to maximize the overall objective at _minimum energy consumption_. As a part of this independent study, I:

<left>
  1. Improved the framework design by converting its static   representation as a <i>Scheme</i> or an <i>XML</i> file to a runtime data structure. <br>
  <left>
  2. Developed a <i>scanner in Java</i> to obtain the runtime structure. <br>
  </left>
  3. Added the functionality for the users to update the framework at <i>runtime</i>. <br>
  4. Automated the generation and solving of the 0-­1   integer representation of the graph using Gurobi. <br>
  5. Achieved near­optimal solutions by developing a <i>heuristic</i> that requires less time and resources. <br>
