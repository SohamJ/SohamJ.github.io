I received my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science from Rutgers University, NJ. I pursued the first two years of my bachelors at Pune Institute of Computer Technology, India(PICT).

 *My courses*
  * Operating Systems
  * Systems Programming
  * Compilers
  * Principles of Programming Languages
  * Design and Analysis of Algorithms
  * Internet Technology
  * Data Structures
  * Object Oriented and Multi core Programming
  * Operating System Administration
  * Microprocessor Architecture, Discrete Structures

  In senior year, I undertook an independent study under Dr. Ulrich Kremer. My work was focused on maintaining a runtime system for a service-based framework and developing a heuristic that obtained a sub-optimal solution to maximize the overall objective at minimum energy consumption.
