I am a Linux enthusiast and have been using the Linux-based OS Ubuntu for more than eight years. I love how open-source gives the users the flexibility to customize their desktop. I am currently writing an installation guide to setup Ubuntu, including the tweaks I implement while setting up my desktop.
